<div id="Mount Apo" class="place" style="display:none">

<h2><p>•Mount Apo: </p></h2>

<p>    Mount Apo with its breathtaking sceneries and mountainscapes is home to well over 200 bird species, over half of which are endemic to the region and are found nowhere else on Earth.
In fact,since the mountain has a high level of biological diversity,it is considered to be at the heart of endemism on the island of Mindanao. Someone could say that the most famous bird in the mountain is the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi). The eagle is currently critically endangered due to habitat loss and killing a Phillipine eagle is highly illegal under Philippine law. All in all, Mount Apo is not a particularly technical climb, although hiring a local guide that can help you is a good idea. The peak is  climbable all year long, it is best hiked between the months of March and May when the weather is generally much more stable. </p>
